I'm the System Research Leader and Managing Information for Student Achievement (MISA) lead at the [Grand Erie District School Board](http://granderie.ca/) in south-western Ontario. My interests include data visualisation, program evaluation and knowledge mobilisation.  

I am currently active in research networks across the province of Ontario including the [Data User Group](https://dugroup.ca/) and [London Region MISA Profession Network](http://misalondon.ca/).
