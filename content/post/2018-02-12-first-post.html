<p>Inspired by Yihui Xie’s <a href="https://slides.yihui.name/2018-blogdown-rstudio-conf-Yihui-Xie.html#1">blogdown package</a> I have jumped into the world of blogging. Going over the presentations from <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/">Rstudio::conf</a> I have become motivated to start documenting my R journey and and share some of my work. I am often asked by colleagues at other organisations how I do something in R so I’m hoping this will provide an easier format to share and explain some of my work.</p>
<p>Right now it’s very basic but as I learn more about the Yihui’s blogdown package I’m sure this space will expand.</p>
