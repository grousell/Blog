      <description>Inspired by Yihui Xie’s blogdown package I have jumped into the world of blogging. Going over the presentations from Rstudio::conf I have become motivated to start documenting my R journey and and share some of my work. I am often asked by colleagues at other organisations how I do something in R so I’m hoping this will provide an easier format to share and explain some of my work.
Right now it’s very basic but as I learn more about the Yihui’s blogdown package I’m sure this space will expand.</description>
